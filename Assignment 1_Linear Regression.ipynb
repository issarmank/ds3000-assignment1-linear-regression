    "1. Complete the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure all plots have axis labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once the notebook is complete, `Restart` your kernel by clicking 'Kernel' > 'Restart & Run All'.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fix any errors until your notebook runs without any problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Submit one completed notebook for the group to OWL by the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Please note, a random seed of 42 needs to be set to ensure the reproducability of the results -- *DO NOT* change this random seed. **If you call additional functions that are based on random number generators, you will need to define their seed to 42 as well**. \n",
